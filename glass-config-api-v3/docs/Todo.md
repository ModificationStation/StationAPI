# TODO List
Mostly for me. In rough order of priority weighted with estimated difficulty.

1. Get people to actually use this and report issues and suggestions to me.
2. Add the ability to easily and cleanly edit config fields programmatically.
3. Add support for colours with an ingame colour picker. Adding an actual colour picker might be a pain the the arse. I have a couple of ideas on how to do this.
4. Add field validation on game load. JSON files are not validated on load, currently.
5. Add block and item selection support. Should be easy enough with StAPI registries. I currently cannot think of a good use for this config option yet, though.
